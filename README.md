## Competitive Programming Walkthrough
---

This repository contains my personal walkthrough and learning journey in competitive programming.
Here I document solutions, notes and insights from solving problems on the platforms **AtCoder**, **Codeforces**.

The purpose of this reposity is to help me -- and hopefully others -- get faster and more accurate at solving problems, while learing and appying standard algorithms and data structures, and ultimately building a strong foundation for competitive programming contests.
